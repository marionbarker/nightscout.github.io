<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<p><strong>Nightscout</strong> (also known as <strong>"CGM in the Cloud"</strong>) is an open-source cloud
application <strong>used by people with diabetes and parents of kids with diabetes</strong> to visualize, store and share the
data from their <strong>Continuous Glucose Monitoring</strong> sensors in real-time. Once
setup, Nightscout acts as a central repository of blood glucose and insulin
dosing/treatment data for a single person, allowing you to view the CGM graph
and treatment data anywhere using just a web browser connected to the internet.</p>
<p>There are several parts to this system. You need somewhere online to
store/process/visualize this data (<strong>a Nightscout Site</strong>), something to upload
CGM data to your Nightscout (<strong>an Uploader</strong>), and then optionally you can use
other devices to access/view this data (<strong>one - or more - Follower</strong>):</p>
<h4 id="nightscout-site">Nightscout Site<a class="headerlink" href="#nightscout-site" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h4>
<p>The Nightscout cloud application can be installed by yourself using hosting
services from various cloud service providers.</p>
<p>Although not necessary, you might prefer to use paid hosting services for your database (to avoid future maintenance tasks) or indeed pay to use a fully-managed Nightscout hosting service to avoid having to personally build and maintain your site yourself.</p>
<h4 id="uploader">Uploader<a class="headerlink" href="#uploader" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h4>
<p>The CGM data is usually sent to Nightscout by an <strong>uploader device</strong> (often
known as an <strong>"Uploader"</strong>) such as a mobile/cellphone running an app such as xDrip+, Spike, xDrip4iOS or Medtronic Uploader. Alternatively, the CGM data can be pulled directly from your online Dexcom or Medtronic CareLink accounts. The application you'll need for uploading the data depends on which CGM device you're using and what type of mobile device you have. Once you've read this page (yes - all the way to the bottom!), you can find more information here about <a href="uploader/uploaders/">Uploaders</a>.</p>
<h4 id="followers">Followers<a class="headerlink" href="#followers" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h4>
<p>In addition to viewing the data using a web browser, there are also
applications available for mobile devices, smartwatches, electronic devices and
other cloud-based services which allow you alternative ways to view and
interact with the information stored within your Nightscout site (often known
as <strong>"Followers"</strong>).</p>

<h2 id="development-history">Development History<a class="headerlink" href="#development-history" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<p>Nightscout was developed by people with Type 1 Diabetes and parents of kids with T1D and has
continued to be developed, maintained, and supported by volunteers, clinical
use, and commercial sponsorship. The web portal known as Nightscout is made by the <a href="https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/graphs/contributors">CGM
Remote Monitor
Contributors</a>
and the Nightscout community over years.</p>
<p>When first implemented, Nightscout was a solution specifically for remote monitoring of Dexcom G4 CGM data. Today, there are Nightscout solutions available for nearly all commercial CGM sensors. The goal of the project is to allow the remote monitoring, sharing and analysis of any T1D's glucose levels using existing monitoring devices.

<h2 id="what-are-the-values-of-nightscout">What are the values of Nightscout<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-values-of-nightscout" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<p>We are compelled in the pursuit of <strong>humane</strong> and <strong>equitable</strong> application of
technology to <strong>liberating people from the burden of diabetes</strong>.  We are not
waiting to deliver the benefits we've found in <strong>sharing <em>all</em> diabetes
experiences</strong>.  Nightscout is free to contribute, free to access, free to
criticize, free to try, free to depend on, free to modify, and free to
distribute.  The Nightscout community demands <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>dignity</strong> for all
community members.  The reputation of the Nightscout community is affected by
the <strong>quality</strong> of the source code, the quality of our relationships, the
quality of our discussions, what we are known for doing: the way we treat each other.
Users of Nightscout are impacted by <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>security</strong> and
<strong>confidentiality</strong> of
Nightscout.  Therefore, the developers and contributors of Nightscout strive to
improve the quality of Nightscout while making these opportunities
<strong>accessible</strong> to all.</p>
<p>Nightscout's <strong>longevity</strong>, the application, the ecosystem, and the culture demand
we use all tools at our disposable to achieve the values in a <strong>sustainable</strong> way.
We are not waiting to do whatever it takes to meet the needs of people affected
by the inhumane demands of diabetes.  Our active <strong>collaboration</strong> against the
burden of diabetes creates the results we desire.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need">What Do I Need?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-i-need" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<p>You really don't need too much to get Nightscout up and running but let's start with the basics.</p>
<p>Are you sitting comfortably? Then let's begin.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A CGM sensor: Dexcom, Medtronic, Libre (plus an additional transmitter) or Eversense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way to <a href="uploader/uploaders/">upload</a> your data (this is generally an internet-connected mobile phone with a matching uploader app)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internet access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 hour of "quiet" time (a <s>beer</s> nice cup of coffee is optional but highly recommended)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic computer skills and the ability to <strong><em>carefully</em></strong> follow the installation guides shown on this site </p>
<p><em><strong>"Carefully"</strong> means that you will thoroughly read, follow and complete each step without skipping any and without giving up thinking that it is too difficult - it isn't, you just need to be patient.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">IMPORTANT</p>
<p>Before using Nightscout, it is important to understand that this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>is an open-source, community-based project and is not supported by any company</li>
<li>is not officially approved or regulated for diabetes therapy and/or treatment in any way</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You must understand that you take full responsibility for building and running this system and you agree to do so at your own risk.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">SAFETY</p>
<ul>
<li>This project requires a working internet connection and availability of third-party cloud services<ul>
<li>Do not rely only on Nightscout as the only way you have of knowing your blood glucose values and trends</li>
<li>Make sure you're ready to cope with an unexpected failure and always have alternative ways to check your blood glucose levels</li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to run Nightscout for free. Classic DIY Nightscout requires free accounts at
three companies: GitHub, MongoDB, and Heroku. All three of which will demand
some sort of maintenance and will generate sales and warning emails over the course of the years. DIY Nightscout is unfortunately not set it and forget it and will require upgrades and even platform changes to follow software evolutions or policies of the companies used when you created your site.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">There ain't no such thing as a free lunch</p>
<p>You might not pay for service, but also this means you'll be spending a lot of hours on this.</p>
</div>
<p>Free databases like the Atlas M0 Sandbox provided by
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> will hold a limited amount of data (512MB)
and you may eventually need to delete old records (maybe every 3-4 years with
standard Nightscout CGM usage). You can increase even further the database
capacity to 2GB/5GB ($9/$25 USD/month) by paying for an M2/M5 Shared Cluster if you wish.</p>
<p>Application servers such as <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>'s "Free" plan will
provide enough server hours to run a single Nightscout site without any
downtime. If you need to run several sites on the same account, have "never sleeping" apps, you can easily
upgrade to a paid "Hobby" plan ($7 per dyno per month).</p>

ns.10BE.de was started in Nov 2017 and offers full managed Nightscout Services. You can create Nightscout with a few clicks and you don't have to worry about maintenance, nightscout updates or MongoDB- and CPU Limits/Space.

The servers are located in different data centers (fail-safe) in Germany and Finland/France (can be selected). And are watched by [monitoring from uptimerobot](https://10be.de/en/status.html) and our own Slackbot and when a Server was down, it restarts self and send a twitter message.
</p>

<p><strong><em>It is 10BE for free?</em></strong></p>
<p>Not anymore, because the costs were simply not covered by the donations.</p>
<p>A Nightscout Instance will be costs 4,99 Euro a month, but how larger the interval, then more discount there is.</p>
<p>You got every 6-8 hours a Backup of your Database and Settings.
You can import the Data from your old Nightscout Instance or MongoDB-Database or upload Data (freestyle, dexcom, omnipod, csv) via CSV File.</p>
<p>To see what you will get for it, take a look at our <a href="https://10be.de/en/pricing.html">features page</a>. The registration is free.</p>

<p>You will find many willing and open-hearted people in the Facebook groups. </p>
<p>The main group for all Nightscout support is the "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cgminthecloud/">CGM in the Cloud</a>" Facebook group.</p>
<p>There are also many local Nightscout communities and you'll probably be able to find one in your own country and language if this helps.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Technical Support</p>
<p>This project is often considered "<strong>Do It Yourself</strong>" (DIY) and supported by volunteers. Whilst you will almost certainly always will find someone ready to help you for free, building your own Nightscout site <strong>doesn't entitle you to any form of support</strong> from anybody.</p>
<p>The open-source diabetes movement is founded on the idea of <strong>paying it forward</strong> and helping others to learn things that others took their time to help teach you about.</p>
<p><em>Ask nicely, and nice people will always do nice things and help you.</em></p>
<p>Nightscout developers are busy people and we'd like them to concentrate on maintaining and improving Nightscout, not only supporting users. (This means <strong>do not</strong> send them private messages or friend requests just to help fix something that is already clearly documented or for help that can be easily requested in the CGM in the Cloud group)</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Facebook Privacy</p>
<p>You'll find a lot of useful and friendly diabetes-oriented groups on Facebook and it's probably the best place to find online support. Some people express concerns about using Facebook: if you're worried about your privacy just remember Facebook will only share the information that you <strong>allow</strong> it to share.</p>
